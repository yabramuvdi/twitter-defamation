# twitter-defamation
---

The objective of this short project is to accurately predict if a tweet contains defamatory language against Spain's current president (Pedro Sanchez). To do this, we will use some preprocessed tweets that contain a label indicating if they are defamatory (=1) or not (=0). We will train a variety of models and, through a comprehensive gridsearch cross validation, will find the best performing one. Finally, we will predict a defamation score for a set of tweets for which we did not have any label.
